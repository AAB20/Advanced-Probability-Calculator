python main.py
```

The program will prompt you to select the type of probability calculation you wish to perform, guiding you through each step.

### Example Calculations

1. **Conditional Probability**:
   - Use the formula `P(A|B) = P(A âˆ© B) / P(B)` to calculate conditional probabilities.

2. **Bayes' Theorem**:
   - Compute posterior probabilities with the formula `P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)`.

3. **Binomial Distribution**:
   - Calculate the probability of success in a binomial experiment with parameters such as the number of trials and probability of success.

4. **Combinations and Permutations**:
   - Calculate combinations and permutations for selecting or arranging objects from a set.
